        <h3>We are a start-up company</h3>
        <p>We provide micro-level insurance targeted at small farmers. (cultivating area up to 50ha. )
            At the core is the idea of smart contracts, which execute themselves when the insurance event occurs, and these contracts are implemented through a decentralized blockchain technology, which is a transaction log providing information on premiums paid, insurance underwritten and benefits paid. <br> On the basis of the blockchain platform, the benefits are also paid out, as it automatically collects information from authorised (validated) external sources, as a result of which it is established whether an insurance event has occurred. When the insured event occurs, the platform automatically transfers compensation to the insured person. <br> The other idea on which the product is based is index insurance, which links benefits to changes in a particular climate index - as an independent benchmark for fair insurance benefits. The proposal is to initially offer insurance on the basis of a rainfall index, with the premium calculated on the basis of the objective risk, given that the insured event belongs to the pure and natural. The benefits are the same at the respective cumulative values of the index for the respective zone, and it is not the damage occurring that is important here, but the change in the climate index.</p>

        <h3>Index insurance</h3>
        <p>Index insurance is a relatively new but innovative approach to insurance provision that pays out benefits on the basis of a predetermined index (e.g. rainfall level) for loss of assets and investments, primarily working capital, resulting from weather and catastrophic events.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain technology</h3>
        <p>A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain stores information electronically in digital format. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin, for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions. The innovation with a blockchain is that it guarantees the fidelity and security of a record of data and generates trust without the need for a trusted third party.</p>

        <h3>Secured transactions</h3>
        <p>Transaction security helps to protect the integrity of financial transactions and ensure that all parties involved in the transaction are protected from fraud and other malicious activities. It also helps to protect the data and transactions that occur between two or more parties.</p>

        <h3>Best Price</h3>
        <p> It's important to consider not only the price, but also the quality, features, and reputation of the product or service. Sometimes, the cheapest option may not provide the best value in the long run if it doesn't meet your needs or requires frequent repairs or replacements.

            Ultimately, the best price for you depends on your budget, preferences, and priorities. </p>

        <h3>Smart Contracts</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts are contracts that are coded and stored on the blockchain. They automate agreements between the creator and recipient, making them immutable and irreversible. Their primary purpose is to automate the execution of an agreement without intermediaries, ensuring that all parties can confirm the conclusion instantly. Additionally, they can be programmed to initiate a workflow based on specific circumstances. <br>

            So, what is an executed contract? An executed contract in terms of a smart contract refers to the successful completion of the agreement programmed into the smart contract. Once all the conditions specified in the code of the smart contract are met and the required actions are performed, the contract is considered executed. Popularized by the Ethereum blockchain, smart contracts have led to the networkâ€™s array of decentralized applications (DApps) and other use cases. <br>
            
            One key benefit of blockchain networks is the automation of tasks that traditionally require a third-party intermediary. For example, instead of needing a bank to approve a fund transfer from a client to a freelancer, the process can happen automatically thanks to a smart contract. This reduces the time and cost involved in traditional contract execution.</p>

        <h3>Protect Your Agriculture</h3>
        <p>In agriculture, smart contracts have unique implementations in the form of helping farmers insure their crops and claim damages with insurance companies. Normally, it is a painfully slow and burdensome process, both on the side of the grower and the company that insures them. <br>

            Unpredictable weather anomalies make it difficult to correctly estimate and quickly report the exact losses they cause. This leaves room for fraud and makes the process an operational nightmare.
            <br>
            Through setting up tailored smart blockchain contracts, the damage claim can be triggered via changes to weather conditions that meet certain criteria, easing the process for farmers and insurers.</p>
